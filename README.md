Mastering Hashcat: A Guide to Password Cracking and Ethical Usage
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive guide on Hashcat, a popular password-cracking tool used by cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers. The project focuses on understanding password security, implementing various attack strategies, and exploring Hashcat's advanced features. The guide is aimed at educating users on responsible and ethical usage in cybersecurity to enhance password protection.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide users with:

A detailed understanding of Hashcat and its capabilities.
A step-by-step guide on how to set up and configure Hashcat.
An exploration of various attack strategies used for password cracking.
Guidance on using Hashcat ethically, in line with cybersecurity best practices.
Insights into cryptographic weaknesses and methods to mitigate them.
Features
Setup Instructions: Complete guidance on installing Hashcat on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Attack Techniques: Covers brute-force, dictionary, mask, combinator, and hybrid attacks.
Advanced Features: Utilizing GPU acceleration, tuning performance, and handling various hash types.
Ethical Considerations: Discusses legal boundaries and how to ethically use Hashcat for penetration testing and security assessments.
Sample Use Cases: Real-world scenarios where Hashcat is applied to identify and fix security flaws in password encryption.
Installation
Install Hashcat: Follow the installation guide provided in official Hashcat documentation.
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mastering-hashcat.git
cd mastering-hashcat
Environment Setup: Make sure you have the necessary hardware for GPU acceleration and updated drivers.
Usage
Basic Command:

bash
Copy code
hashcat -m [hash-type] -a [attack-mode] -o [output-file] [hash-file] [wordlist-file]
Common Hash Types:

0 = MD5
100 = SHA1
1800 = SHA512
Attack Modes:

0 = Straight (Dictionary) Attack
3 = Brute-force Attack
6 = Hybrid Wordlist + Mask Attack
For detailed attack examples, refer to the attack_techniques.md file.

Ethical Usage
This project emphasizes the ethical use of Hashcat. It is intended for legal penetration testing, security assessments, and research purposes only. Misuse of Hashcat for unauthorized hacking or exploitation of systems is strictly prohibited and may violate laws and regulations. Always obtain permission before conducting any security testing.
